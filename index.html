					<p>Teachers oftentimes struggle with differentiating between the effectiveness levels in the Questioning and Discussion component (3b) of the Charlotte Danielson Framework for Teaching. Unfortunately, not being able to differentiate between these effectiveness levels is a problem in that teachers may have a different view of their practice than their evaluators. This could lead to the teacher being unable to identify strategies which would improve their practice in this domain, potentially resulting in termination.</p>
					<h3>If the user is willing to engage with the rubric, this tutorial will help the user:</h3>

					<p>The teacher’s questions are of low cognitive challenge, with single correct responses, and are asked in rapid succession. Interaction between the teacher and students is predominantly recitation style, with the teacher mediating all questions and answers; the teacher accepts all contributions without asking students to explain their reasoning. Only a few students participate in the discussion.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3", "developing" "rubric">
					<p>The teacher’s questions lead students through a single path of inquiry, with answers seemingly determined in advance. Alternatively, the teacher attempts to ask some questions designed to engage students in thinking, but only a few students are involved. The teacher attempts to engage all students in the discussion, to encourage them to respond to one another, and to explain their thinking, with uneven results.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3", "effective" "rubric">
					<p>While the teacher may use some low-level questions, he poses questions designed to promote student thinking and understanding. The teacher creates a genuine discussion among students, providing adequate time for students to respond and stepping aside when doing so is appropriate. The teacher challenges students to justify their thinking and successfully engages most students in the discussion, employing a range of strategies to ensure that most students are heard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3", "highly_effective" "rubric">
					<p>The teacher uses a variety or series of questions or prompts to challenge students cognitively, advance high-level thinking and discourse, and promote metacognition. Students formulate many questions, initiate topics, challenge one another’s thinking, and make unsolicited contributions. Students themselves ensure that all voices are heard in the discussion.</p>
